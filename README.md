# Purpose of Making
Well there was two reasons of making this website :-
- I somehow convinced my parents that i would do designing and not engineering so i was really excited
- Greed! It is a human nature. I want that Ipad 11 India and mark my first electronic device.
- (Being the smallest in both sides of family is hard, i get only the products which are not only used but had been used for over 2 to 3 times. LOL. Atleast i get all the things at the end.)

# How I made it 
I made this website using HTML + CSS (mainly internal) but for all canvases i also used Javascript.
- I personally do not know how to use Java but canvas was the first and last thing i had learnt of Java.
- Ngl I learnt how to make canvas from youtube but that was always boring. This is the first time i styled it little. I did not knew that we can add photos to background of canvas to make it look like a frame, well that was mind blowing for me.
- All the images in this painting has been taken from pinterest.

# What I Learned
- In question.html and question2.html i do not know why i forgot the way to make options display so i took CBSE mcqs solution site as a inspiration and i used select tag of form display the answer.
- In all my previous sites i had used solid colors or images as background to style my sites by this time is used svgs, which was very new to me. Svgs were recommended to me by Annabel when i asked for suggestions or recommendations.
- (All svg sites were asking for payment information which i did not want to give, svgrepo was the only help for me.)
- I know that all the scgs took time by me to place and are still horribly placed but trust me, it was easy as first time for me but difficult in positioning.
- Also top and bottom border svgs on index.html were making me crashout to position so i deleted them.
- A new way to style canvas - added a image in background so it hugs the canvas like a frame.
- I finally found out that overlapping option- okay so it was actually just me clicking 0 on number pad  from my palm while clicking the right arrow button.
- And most importantly patience. Yes, patience. Believe it or not this was the first time i started something big and did not give up half way. This was the largest project I have made in my life.
- Athena Awards kind of felt like a internship i was doing.

# Goal
- Ipad 11 India!!!
  
- I am really proud of myself. Reason :-
- I, this time followed every single correction and problems which was told by Athena Awards
- I wrote body myself
- I am writing Readme file myself
- This site is actually made solely by me
- I used svgs for designing 
- commited each hour properly with details (well from half way cause i read the message on athena awards about commits half way into the project.)
- I am sorry if commits are not as what was asked
- I am an introvert and never in my life connected internationally once. Athena Awards was first.
- Well i did use Ai for theme colors initially in first two pages for testing the page visuality . I later asked on Ahthena and one of the person recommended me colorhunt site (that was really helpful).
