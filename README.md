# Purpose of Making
Well there was two reasons of making this website :-
- I somehow convinced my parents that i would do designing and not engineering so i was really excited
- Greed! It is a human nature. I want that Ipad 11 India and mark my first electronic device.
- (Being the smallest in both sides of family is hard, i get only the products which are not only used but had been used for over 2 to 3 times. LOL. Atleast i get all the things at the end.)
