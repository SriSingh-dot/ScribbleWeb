        <h2>Geographical situation</h2>
        <p>The pahari region from earlier on now consist of Himachal Pradesh,some adjoining aread of Punjab, aread of Jammu and Kashmir. The pahari region was divided into small states which were ruled ny Rajputs. Rajput princes were often involved and engaged in warfare.

            <h2>Origin and Development</h2>
            <P>The miniature paintings from Pahari school which are known for their lyricism, natural symbolism, serenity, minute details and superb use of color combination and a deep sense of expressing human expression.Local folk art, Mughal style, Rajasthani Art and Gujrat manuscripts, all are combined together in Pahari school of Art. It is a creative combination of all these art. These art styles are of first half of seventeenth century and had already absorbed the styles of Akbar and Jahangir periods. The animated figures in Basohli and indegenous love for colors started with the path of improvement. To finer and sharp lines, delecate and elegant colors, charming figures in Guler, soft contours and graceful forms of women. This Pahari painting celebrates the tenderness of love.<br>
            The pahari region had beauty of nature. The mountains in these regions inspired the artists and artists strated celebrating the glory of the themes of love. Art of artist flourished in Pahari regions freely and independently with the encouraging patronage rulers like Raja Sansar Chand who would support the Pahari art and would not impose any terms and conditions on their art. As a result, pure Hindu Art with other themes started to evolve there. The finest of finest group of miniatures done in the Pahari region is represented by many famous series.<br>
            Many poets and writers saw a fusion is literature and painting. The fusion of music and paintings in Ragamala series is unbeatable and can never be recreated with such color theme, vision, and beauty. The Ragamala series put a benchmark for all other Rajput paintings.The spiritual love of God and soul in the personification of Krishna and Radha is unparallel.  </P>

            <h2>Sub-Schools</h2>
            <p><b><u>1.BASOHLI:-</u></b>The earliest centre of Pahari school of art was Basohli. Basohli was a small town in Jammu region which was under the rule of King Raja Kirpal Pal. Rasamanjari illustrations in 1694 C.E.  were mianiatures executed by an artist named Devidas. The Indian foreign museum has the many number scattered  pieces of two Rasamanjari series .Vigorous and strong lines and glowing features are some of the features of Basohli School of Art. The Basohli art got famous in the neibouring states and it continued till the end of middle of eighteenth century. "Mugdha Nayika" which is a type of heroine which belongs to the National Museum  is an outstanding example of Basohli painting illustrated in miniature. 43rd folio from a series of the Rasamanjari  is represented.  Forceful and bold colors are strong and contrasting the drawing. The emotional intensity of the painting was enhanced with the usage of yellowish monochrome background used in miniature. One of peculiar characteristic of Basohli painting is usage of dark green bettle wings to indicate green jewels and ornaments. Also white color is used for jewellery like pearl stones. The sky is shown as a band of narrow blue sky and white added to the top of blue for the painting. The miniature is framed in a border of brilliant red color.<br>
            An illustration painted by the artist Manaku in 1730 C.E. shows the further devolopment of Basohli Art. The illustration is froma series of Gita-Govinda. The miniature depicts Krishna is company of gopis in a grove on the bank of a river which is in the colloection of the National Museum. <br>
            The facial structure after the development also changed. The drawing composition becomes a little heavy and also tree structure changed. Different tree structures somewhat gives naturalistic character which may be due to the influence of mughal painting over years. Monochrome background, bold lines ,contrasting colors and use of beetle wings for showcasing emerald jewwllery on characters, narrow sky with broad red borders are obsevable in these miniatures.</p>
