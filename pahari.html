        <h2>Geographical situation</h2>
        <p>The pahari region from earlier on now consist of Himachal Pradesh,some adjoining aread of Punjab, aread of Jammu and Kashmir. The pahari region was divided into small states which were ruled ny Rajputs. Rajput princes were often involved and engaged in warfare. This region was also the center for the great artistic activity for the later half of the senventeenth century to the middle of ninteenth century. Many artist from Rajasthan because of mughals settled in Pahari region. These states were also called the sub-schools of Rajput School of Art.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Origin and Development</h2>
            <P>The miniature paintings from Pahari school which are known for their lyricism, natural symbolism, serenity, minute details and superb use of color combination and a deep sense of expressing human expression.Local folk art, Mughal style, Rajasthani Art and Gujrat manuscripts, all are combined together in Pahari school of Art. It is a creative combination of all these art. These art styles are of first half of seventeenth century and had already absorbed the styles of Akbar and Jahangir periods. The animated figures in Basohli and indegenous love for colors started with the path of improvement. To finer and sharp lines, delecate and elegant colors, charming figures in Guler, soft contours and graceful forms of women. This Pahari painting celebrates the tenderness of love.<br>
            The pahari region had beauty of nature. The mountains in these regions inspired the artists and artists strated celebrating the glory of the themes of love. Art of artist flourished in Pahari regions freely and independently with the encouraging patronage rulers like Raja Sansar Chand who would support the Pahari art and would not impose any terms and conditions on their art. As a result, pure Hindu Art with other themes started to evolve there. The finest of finest group of miniatures done in the Pahari region is represented by many famous series.<br>
            Many poets and writers saw a fusion is literature and painting. The fusion of music and paintings in Ragamala series is unbeatable and can never be recreated with such color theme, vision, and beauty. The Ragamala series put a benchmark for all other Rajput paintings.The spiritual love of God and soul in the personification of Krishna and Radha is unparallel.  </P>

            <h2>Sub-Schools</h2>
            <p><b><u>1.BASOHLI:-</u></b>The earliest centre of Pahari school of art was Basohli. Basohli was a small town in Jammu region which was under the rule of King Raja Kirpal Pal. Rasamanjari illustrations in 1694 C.E.  were mianiatures executed by an artist named Devidas. The Indian foreign museum has the many number scattered  pieces of two Rasamanjari series .Vigorous and strong lines and glowing features are some of the features of Basohli School of Art. The Basohli art got famous in the neibouring states and it continued till the end of middle of eighteenth century. "Mugdha Nayika" which is a type of heroine which belongs to the National Museum  is an outstanding example of Basohli painting illustrated in miniature. 43rd folio from a series of the Rasamanjari  is represented.  Forceful and bold colors are strong and contrasting the drawing. The emotional intensity of the painting was enhanced with the usage of yellowish monochrome background used in miniature. One of peculiar characteristic of Basohli painting is usage of dark green bettle wings to indicate green jewels and ornaments. Also white color is used for jewellery like pearl stones. The sky is shown as a band of narrow blue sky and white added to the top of blue for the painting. The miniature is framed in a border of brilliant red color.<br>
            An illustration painted by the artist Manaku in 1730 C.E. shows the further devolopment of Basohli Art. The illustration is froma series of Gita-Govinda. The miniature depicts Krishna is company of gopis in a grove on the bank of a river which is in the colloection of the National Museum. <br>
            The facial structure after the development also changed. The drawing composition becomes a little heavy and also tree structure changed. Different tree structures somewhat gives naturalistic character which may be due to the influence of mughal painting over years. Monochrome background, bold lines ,contrasting colors and use of beetle wings for showcasing emerald jewwllery on characters, narrow sky with broad red borders are obsevable in these miniatures.</p>
      
          <p><b><u>2.GULER:-</u></b> The Jammu group of paintings which mainly consisting of small portraits of Raja Balwant Singh of a small place near Jammu (Jasrota) was the last phase of the Basohli style was colosely followed. The artist was Nainsukh. He originally belonged to Guler but he settled in Jasrota. He worked at both places Jasrota and Guler. The painting of King Balwant Singh brought a unque technique which was highly praised by everyone. Nainsukh excelled in indivisual portrait which over the years beacame a key feature of Pahari Art school. His pallete consisted of soft pastel shades and immence use of white and grey for the portraits. Nainsukh along with his brother Manku and father Pandit Seu Played an important role as artist in bringing their art style to neighbouring areas. Manku's best art work was series of paintings ffrom Geeta-Govinda series. </p>
    
          <p><b><u>3.KANGRA:- </u></b>The Kangra school of art followed the artistic styles from Guler. Kangra school represented the thrid pahase of Pahari school of art in the last quater of eighteenth century.The Guler style is what Kangra style has been developed out of. All the main characteristics of Guker style like the delicacy, of drawing and quantity of naturalism were possesed by Kangra school of art. In Alampur was the main phase of Kangra school. In Kangra paintings women are drawn in profile, all women's nose are in lined with their forehead. The eyes are long, narrow and chin is sharp. The artists did not pay much attention to decoration and stylisation and treated hair of women as flat in their painting. The Kangra paintings ovver years started to flourish and got famous even in neighboring regions.</p>
          <p><b><u>4.KULU-MANDI:-</u></b>In Pahari region, a folk style art of Kulu-Mandi also flourished with nuturalistic Kangra style. The Kulu-Mandi folk art was mainly inspired by local traditions.  These paintings were made with the use of bold lines and dark and dull colors were what is known for. Influence of Kangra art is definetley observed in these paintings but Kulu-Mandi art still maintains its distinct folkish human characters. Large number of Kulu-Mandi portrait paintings of rulers were made in miniature. One example of Kulu-Mandi painting is two girls flying kite. The painting is in folk style of eighteenth century. The artist used bold lines, dark and dull shades to signify classic Kullu Mandi style. The girls are wearing simple costumes and ornaments which were worn by girls at that time period.  </p>
          <p><b><u>5.GARHWAL:-</u></b>On looking at Garhwal paintings, one could misunderstand it for Kangra paintings due to similarities, even though Kangra art it self is an offset of Guler. So one could easily say that both, Kangra and Garhwal art drew its inspiration from a common source, Guler Art Style. A distinct Garhwal stye emerged after a strong Guler influence which was because of marital relations between the rulers of both regions. The paintings which emerged depicted sceneric beauty more than the story. The mountains, rivers, trees , all were shown and depicted with grace. The peaceful setting in the backdrop of beautiful figures in a romantic composition brings the nostalgia of calmness, simplicity and peace. Once a nephew of Aurangzep had escaped , and with him came few artist. One of their descendents improved the Kangra style and excelled in this field.</p>
          <p><b><u>6.CHAMBA:-</u></b>Basohli style of Pahari paintings took roots in Chamba. The artists migrated from Basohli to Chamba in eighteenth century after the decline of Kangra school. Many of the rulers patronized  this school of painting where portraits and Hindu folks and legends took priority. The painting of Chamba cover in its miniatures the effect of folk art, murals, and the Mughal influence. The paintings from Chamba School of art were generally painted with Hindu, religious themes. The main painters from this region are, Nikku from Basohli. </p>
