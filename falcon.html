    <h2>Details</h2>
    <p><b>SUBJECT MATTER: </b> This is a vertical painting by Ustad Mansoor who was the best bird painter at that time amd could draw many kinds of birds. He drew this painting based of Jahangir's love for nature, birds and animals. Jahangir was a keen falconer and treasured fine species of falcons from different places even though he loved all birds. The falon pet was gifted to Jahangir by the Persian emperor, Shah Abbas. But sadely his pet falcon was mauled and killed by a cat. Jahangir loved his pet falcon dearly so he asked his painters to draw the image of his precious pet falcon and that painting to be preserved in Jahangir Nama. </p><br>
    <p><b>DESCRIPTION: </b>Ustad Mansoor who clearly saw the fondness of emperor Jahangir to his pet falcon, decided to draw the falcon as a tribute. In his painted illustration a tamed falcon is seated on a bird rest which is cuhioned for comfort. Some lines are written in arabic on the bird rest in the painting. Those words says "Nadir-ul-Asr" which was the title awarded to him. The artist accurately drew the crewl eyes of falcon in his painting just like a real one. The falcon is painted in brown and white and this composition is against a yellow background. There are minute brown details on its wings. The falcon is painted with sharp beak in brown, cruel eyes is painted in light brown and yellow ochre deep color. One could see the large grippy sharp and perfect claws of the seated falcon. At the back of its neck, there is a patch of feathers. Black markings painted with dots are all over the body. There is a thin string around its neck which makes him tied to the bird-rest.<br>
    At the top just below the border, two words are written, Jahangir Patashah. Near the falcon on the left of the painting Bahari is written and at the bottom Uttam is written. Here "Bahari" means falcon and "Uttam" means excellent. </p>
    <p><b>HUMAN VALUES: </b><br>
    1.Pets and animals are to be loved and cared for.<br>
    2.One should get a pet or meet animals regularly for psychological well being</p>
