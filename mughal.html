            <p> The refined and polished Indian school or art by the persians was the Mughal school art. The mughal school of art was not any new. Ofcourse the Paresians took help from indians in refining and polishing the Indian School of art style. Rajasthani art and Persian art in mixed together and this mixer is Mughal Art style.</p>
            <p><b>INDIAN ART (RAJASTHANI) + PERSIAN ART = MUGHAL ART</b></p>
            <p>Local indian styles and themes with Persian and later European influences are all combined together for miniature paintings of Mughal School of Art. All the themes and styles combined creates a rich mix of cultures.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Origin and Deveopment </h2>
            <p> In history of Pinting in India, the origin of Mughal school of Painting is considered to be a landmark. The new culture of painting was developed under  the rule of Mughal rulers. The new culture of this mughal style reached its peak in the fifteenth century. Timur, a mughal ruler gave his due regard and importance to the artists in his court. There was an artist named Bihzad at that time. He was basically a persian artist out of those artists at that time. He was also know as "Raphael of the East". in the court of Sultan Hussain Mirza, he was the the greatest painter. After the passing away of Sultan Hussain Mirza, he took job in the court of Sufaid Shah Ismail.</p>
            <p>The founder of Mughal Empire in India, Babur, was a descendent of the Timur fanily. He was very fond of paintings and arts which was quite unexpected from a brave soldier and a highly able commander. Babur was really a person to remeber. He mostly spent his life in battle field and unfortunetely died in 1530 AD. Hamayun, his son spent thirteen years of his life in exile and later when Sher Shah Suri became the emperor of Delhi, He defeated Hamayun two times. Even in battle time Hamayun started a painting, "Dastaan-E-Amir", which was later completed under the rule of Akbar. The two artist who completed it were famous painters from Akbar's court who came from Kanauj. Hamayun died in Circa, 1555 C.E. after ascending the throne of Delhi. After his death he left his throne for his only heir successor, Akbar. Akbar, the ruler every Indian knows. He probably was the most famous ruler in India and his name is still known by even little kids who have not even read history. On him many manuscripts and arts were named. Even many artist gave colored art pieces of him. According to Ain-e-Akbari of Abul Fazal, during that period, about 1400 events had been painted, out of which few are available now. Jahangir who was son of Akbar was also a lover of Art and nature just like his grandfather Humayun. In the time period of Jahangir, the Mughal Miniature Art reached a very high level of excellence and peaked at that time.</p>
            <p>Jahangir actually played an important role in development of Mughal School of Art. He encouraged and praised artists for their art works. And as a result, the artists painted many types of birds, flowers, animals during his time. The portaits gained its popularity under his rule and got famous. Under his rule the individual paintings whih were mounted in albums became popular. Portraits of women were more illustrated than men. Greater charm was aquired by the paintinngs,patronage under the reign of Jahangir. He was fascinated with nature and enjoyed watching the paintings, portraits on birds, animals, trees and flowers. Every single miniature paintings or portraits under Jahangir had something common, higly detailed and beautiful backgrounds displaying nature. After his death, Shah Jahan took over the throne and became the emperor of Mughal empire in year, 1628. He was a lover of fascinating architecture and not art and paintings. SO he did not patronise paintings like his father, Jahangir. He got many forts, palaces and mosques to hi name. The famous Lal Kila(Red fort), Taj Mahal are his remarkable architecture which are known by everyone. He admired sparkling gems and jewels and believed in things monumental and greater than ancestors. </p>
            <p>Aurangzeb today is known for his cruelity and was not very loved as others. His bitter enemy was art and paintings. He did not support the artists so most of the artist traveeled and settled in hill areas where they got support from the rulers. In this way, Aurangzeb himself marked the end of Mughal paintings. But when the last Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah Zafar took over the throne, the Mughal art which had vanished under the rule of Aurengzeb got revived. After 1712 A.D, the detoriation in Mughal art was again witnessed in the quality of style. Even adter retaining it's outer form, it was lifeless from inside. It seemed that the new paintings had lost the inherent quality of Mughal Art. Finally in eighteenth century, the glorious Miniature Mughal Art style came to an end. From this one could easily say that the Mughal style started with Mughals and it's end was with Mughals in India. </p>

              <h2>Characteristics </h2>
              <p>Manuscipt,portraits and miniature art was highly loved by the mughal emperors.The following are some characteristics of Mughal Art style :-</p>
              
              <p><b><u>1.Profile-Face: </u></b>This is one of the main features of every Mughal painting. Almost all portraits or individual portraits were drawn profile or one could say Ek-Chasm in hindi. Even if the faces be frontal or profile, the face would always be with one eye. In Iranian paintings which were intoduced were in ded-chasm (ded-one and a half, chasm- eyes). Even if the Mughals had choice for ded-chasm, they chose eak chasm. </p>
              
              <p><b><u>2.Special Decoration: </u></b>The special decorations in these mughal paintings were done with borders. The borders is the main effect Mughal had of Iranian paintings. Almost all the paintings have been ornamented with broad beautiful borders. Borders makes the art inside the border highlight. Some borders were also adorned with beautiful calligraphy, clay mould designs, flowers and motifs. In some paintings, the borders are drawn as the attention gainer and are more prominent then the painting itself. One could say that introduction of borders made the paintings lose its dominence due to border decoration. The script written in arabic can be seen clearly on the borders.</p>
              
              <p><b><u>3.Royal Splender:</u></b>During the Mughal rulers, royal splenders and descipline were craved by them. They loved it. Suppose there is a meusical demonstration happening in royal court in front of the emperor, in the painting the emperor is shown sitting with a bolster in a royal style and the dancers are dancing in front of him and other court officials. The performers also are singers and instument players. We can sense royality even in a normal performancce gathering and these types of paintings were highly demanded by the rulers of Mughals.</p>
             
              <p><b><u>4.Historical Scenes:- </u></b> In today's time when we find the art pieces, we can easily tell that most of the art pieces have been painted in Mughal schools, in mughal styles. Most of the historic events were painted from the Akbar time period. One of such painting is Kissa-Amir-Hamza. </p>
              
              <p><b><u>5.Fine Line Drawing:- </u></b>Fine line style was a feature which also influenced the Rajasthani Art school. Delicat and fine linings are what portraits were made with. It's kind of a signature style. From fine lining you could notice even minute details like facial hair which was drawn by the artist carefullyand tried to paint each of them. Little to little details are made from fine lining. </p>
             
              <p><b><u>6.Portraits:-</u></b>There is an abudance of portraits in the Mughal school. Along with emperors, portraits of saints were also painted. The Mughal rulers were fond of portraits and encouraged artists to make them. There was always a fine liking in the portraits done under the Mughals </p>
             
              <p><b><u>7.Religious themes:- </u></b> Even after being a Mughal artist all the painters depicted the scenes from Hindu Mythology, legends and epics gracefully and beautifully. Love stories were also highly illustrated. Not only this, the Arabic, Islamic and Persian episodes and stories were depicted by the Mughal artists from Mughal Art School. Artists were inspired by all the religions and did not descriminate within the religions. From this we all can praise the Mughal emperors at that time who were secular and patronage. </p>
              
              <p><b><u>8.Garments:- </u></b>The garments in each of the paintings can be seen on how beautifully and ornamentally they have been painted by the artists. Transparent white color was highly used for chunnis and most of the paintings were in garments meant for summers. The males in the paintings are wearing angarkhas, Chridar pajamas and decorated turbans. You could notice the use of stipping for delicate shading.</p>
              
              <p><u><b>9.Use of Halos:- </b></u>The halos were drawn to show the supremacy of Royal kings. The Mughal rulers were very proud of their earned power, and why not be they were very powerful at that time and huge amount of lands were under their rule. So the artist used to make halos around their heads to show the royal lineage and supremacy amongst others in the painting.</p>
              
              <p><b><u>10.European style:- </u></b>Over the time, the European style of paintings influenced the Mughal Art Styles. The 3D effect and naturalistic treatment of landscape started during the rule of Akbar. But this  European influenced style  got more pronounced later, under the rule of Jahangir. Earlier the perspective was multilayered but on seeing the European art, the influence took over and the artists started to paint single perspective. Not only this, shading was also adopted which now showed roundness of figures be it human or animal. </p>

              <p><u><b>11.Depiction of Nature:- </b></u>From initial phase animals, birds, flowers and trees were painted beautifully. The nature scenes showed animals near river drinking water, hunting scenes and battle scenes. Like Lion is painted sneakingly tip toeing in bushes and hundting its prey. If there are more than one tree drawn then all te trees will have different shape of leaves and were painted accurately. Even different colors are used. The naturalistic treatment shows European influence. </p>

              <p><u><b>12.Ornamental designs:- </b></u>In the paintings, the walls and ceilings of court rooms have beutiful ornamental designs. The creepers are rhythemic and smooth, the designs are geometrical and floral.</p>

              <p><u><b>13.Expressing:- </b></u>All expression of ideas have been painted accurately. From looking at faces, the emotions are clearly seen in paintings. The depiction of sad emperor, ruthless and jealous queens, obedient and loyal servants and nervous boatman are drawn spot on.</p>

              <p><u><B>14.Gold and Silver:-</B></u>Gold and silver colors were used by painters for very long time. Even the Rajathani schools were taking this feature after the mughal influence. In necklaces and shoes of kings, the golden and silver color were used carefully. Golden colors were also used elegantly in border decoration.</p>

              <p><u><b>15.Calligraphy:- </b></u>Calligraphy was used to give a sense of royality to the painting. Most paintings have calligraphy with black color on it. And the artist have written their name in small size in beautiful calligraphy.</p>

              <p><u><b>16.Depiction of Animals and Birds:- </b></u>Just like in Rajasthani Art School, animals and birds have been used as to depict something in painting. Like birds with clouds are painted for romantic scenes. Ustad Mansoor was the best bird painter. He painted birds in different style.</p>

              <p><u><b>17.Natural Color:- </b></u>In Mughal Art mostly colors from nature were used which were attractive. Initially flat colors were used but with European influence we can witness shading of colours. The appropriate colors for every composition have been applied with great care in painting. </p>

              <p><u><b>18.Crowdy Scenes:- </b></u>In some paintings, crowded seens have been painted. In some paintings due to many people repeatition of characters were shown.</p>

          <h2>Methods and Materials</h2>
          <p>There was a handmade paper called "Wasli", on which Mughal miniature paintings started to be illustrated. Wasli was specially prepared by gluing thin sheets of paper together. The paper consisted of ruled lines for writing and some space designated for painting. When the text was written, the artist would paint the visual according to the lines he wrote. The artists and painters from workshops used to make their own colors from nature and use those natural colors. They made these paints by grinding and mixing different pigments. The brushes which were used for minute details were actually made with the hair of squirrel or cat. Paintings like all other miniature school was a group effort and a fixed task was given to every artist. There was a pretty chance that they were given increment if the work was liked . There were records of the names and ranks of every artist as they enjoyed in royal painting workshop.Burnishing with the agate stone was the final step after finishing making the miniature painting. Powdered gold and silver were mixed with colors or were dusted to add refinement to the painting. </p>
