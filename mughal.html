            <h2>Origin and Deveopment </h2>
            <p> In history of Pinting in India, the origin of Mughal school of Painting is considered to be a landmark. The new culture of painting was developed under  the rule of Mughal rulers. The new culture of this mughal style reached its peak in the fifteenth century. Timur, a mughal ruler gave his due regard and importance to the artists in his court. There was an artist named Bihzad at that time. He was basically a persian artist out of those artists at that time. He was also know as "Raphael of the East". in the court of Sultan Hussain Mirza, he was the the greatest painter.

Even many artist gave colored art pieces of him. According to Ain-e-Akbari of Abul Fazal, during that period, about 1400 events had been painted, out of which few are available now. Jahangir who was son of Akbar was also a lover of Art and nature just like his grandfather Humayun. In the time period of Jahangir, the Mughal Miniature Art reached a very high level of excellence and peaked at that time.</p>
