    <h2>Six Limbs Of Indian Painting</h2>

    <p>
      Ok So the Six Limbs of Indian Paintings is called Shadangas. Shadangas is a word formed from two different words."Shad" in Shadanga means six and "Anga" means part. SO SHadanga meaning is actually six limbs or six canons of arts on which the whole world's painting was based on. Shadanga was, I think, what laid base for the main elements of painting and principles of art in the early centuries (maybe 1st).
    </p>

    <div class="images">
      <img src="dr3.jpg" alt="Painting 1">
      <img src="dr2.jpg" alt="Painting 2">
    </div>

    <p>Since ancient times the art and its techniques were studied carefully . And it is believed that it was first recorded in Chitrasutra of Vishnudharmottara Purana.(meaning-  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnudharmottara_Purana ).The oldest ever painting info was recorde in this Purana. The same  conons were also discussed in Bharat Muni's sanskrit texts as well. In 20th century (yesss the British India ),Abanindranath Tagore  (nephew of Rabindranath Tagore) analysed the Shdangas and later wrote a great detailed essay on it while citing different examples from everyday life of his. I believe thath thre was also a shlok (from brave search).

      <p>"Roopbhedah pramanani bhava-lavanya-yojanam/</p>  
      <p>Sadrishyam varnakabhangam iti chitram shadakam //"</p>
    <p>(well i don't remember the exact meaning but it was  listed by the Sage Vatsyayana as a shlok in his  written sanskrit script called Kamasutra.) </p>


    <h3>1. Roopa-Bheda </h3>
    <p>'Roopa' means the outer like the outer appearance or part like what other sees you from outside.Well the observation of such forms can aso be mental.'Bheda' on the other hand means differences.......ya differences. Combining the word together......Appearance difference. So a painter have to work hard and carefully examine and study of 'Roop-Bheda' by the painters to be able to depict the scenes and things as they appear as they truly are and their painting resembles it. The painter needs to know the difference beatween the non living and non living forms and also natural and man-made forms. This knowledge only comes from experience and if not experience then 'Ruchi' (Interest). Ruchi plays a very important role in Roop-Bheda (Well you might be wondering why am i using Ruchi instead of interest? Well it sounds cool) . Ruchi helps an artist in achieving and creating a masterpiece.  </p>
    

    <h3>Suppose Three Artist Paint A Woman</h3>
    <p>So there are three paintings. One of the artist painted a woman dancing, second painted a woman combing and the third painted a woman feeding a baby. Well how will the observer know that the lady dancing is a noble woman practicing dance or a proffesional dance artist?, if the woman combing is a queen or a maid getting ready for her duties, if the woman feeding the baby is his mother or the caretaker. This can only be determined if the painter depicts the Roop-Bheda elegantly and accordingly. What would be the expression of a queen bride on her face? happiness or a  </p>

    <h3>2.PRAMANA</h3>
    <p>So Pramana actually means the correct knowledge of the proportion of different forms. There is a power of "Prama" which teaches us all the exact measure and the distance with logical calculation. This power of "Pramana" is actually present in all human beings. Imagine a prey animal like a deer.....in deep jungle.A light jiggle sounds from bushes could be felt by it whether it's a predator moving sound or some harmless creature roaming. When we paint a landscape,the space has to be divided into different sections like foreground,middle ground and background so that the harmonious composition can be created. All these sections altogether consists of area of sky,trees and water bodies. The fusion and mixing of colors for showing the line of horizon. This simple concept of bringing and binding thses things together to complete the painting is what we call "The Power of PRAMANA" </p>
    <p>Pramana not only gives us understanding of space but also decides as to how much exposure of a thing or a particular shade/coour would make it appealing (Guys do not judge......i am not a professional i am just creating this website)</p>
