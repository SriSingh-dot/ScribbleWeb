    <h2>Six Limbs Of Indian Painting</h2>

    <p>
      Ok So the Six Limbs of Indian Paintings is called Shadangas. Shadangas is a word formed from two different words."Shad" in Shadanga means six and "Anga" means part. SO SHadanga meaning is actually six limbs or six canons of arts on which the whole world's painting was based on. Shadanga was, I think, what laid base for the main elements of painting and principles of art in the early centuries (maybe 1st).

    </div>

    <p>Since ancient times the art and its techniques were studied carefully . And it is believed that it was first recorded in Chitrasutra of Vishnudharmottara Purana.(meaning-  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnudharmottara_Purana ).The oldest ever painting info was recorde in this Purana. The same  conons were also discussed in Bharat Muni's sanskrit texts as well. In 20th century (yesss the British India ),Abanindranath Tagore  (nephew of Rabindranath Tagore) analysed the Shdangas and later wrote a great detailed essay on it while citing different examples from everyday life of his. I believe thath thre was also a shlok (from brave search).

      <p>"Roopbhedah pramanani bhava-lavanya-yojanam/</p>  
      <p>Sadrishyam varnakabhangam iti chitram shadakam //"</p>
    <p>(well i don't remember the exact meaning but it was  listed by the Sage Vatsyayana as a shlok in his  written sanskrit script called Kamasutra.) </p>


    <h3> Roopa-Bheda </h3>
    <p>'Roopa' means the outer like the outer appearance or part like what other sees you from outside.Well the observation of such forms can aso be mental.'Bheda' on the other hand means differences.......ya differences. Combining the word together......Appearance difference. So a painter have to work hard and carefully examine and study of 'Roop-Bheda' by the painters to be able to depict the scenes and things as they appear as they truly are and their painting resembles it. The painter needs to know the difference beatween the non living and non living forms and also natural and man-made forms. This knowledge only comes from experience and if not experience then 'Ruchi' (Interest)  </p>
