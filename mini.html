    <p>Any painting done in small size on any surface, medium or plane is called "Miniature Painting". Earlier in India they were made on palm leaves, a piece of cloth or a piece of leather. After years, it was drawn on handmade paper. Even after being mini in size, the paintings were presented with minute details. These were mainly portraits, an illustration of a story or a painting inspired from daily life of a man. From medieval times Indian Art schools were highly influenced by miniature paintings. We find strong tradition of painting in different schools of painting. Example â€“ The Pala School or Eastern School, the Western Indian School or Jain School of Art.</p>

    <p>Ellara and Ajanta were the great centres of Buddhism leaning and art .These schools saw greatest piece of art as murals and <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">frescoes </a>. After this people witnessed a great phase of Buddhism and Buddhism art in India.For real I saw like 100 paintings and sculptures only on Gautam Buddha in the museum. Earlier a large number of manuscript on palm leaves related to Buddhism were written and also illustrated with with buddhist deities .</p>
    <p>The Pala paintings got the name from the Kings Dharam Pal and Dev Pal while their chief artists were Dhiman and his son Vittapal. That reflects and resembles the feelings of classical art of Ajanta. Paintings were of graceful figures and simple composition giving a calming aura. One of the typical Buddhist palm-leaf manuscript which was illustrated in Pala is Astasahasrika <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Prajnaparamita</a>. It is a manuscript of Mahayana Buddhism and also written in eight thousand lines. The writings were done after leaving some space in the middle for fitting paintings and thereafter the script was sent to painters for illustrations. All the script were binded together with a thread running through two holes made on both side of the folios. But they were damaged over the years as vermillon and sandal paste was smeared on them as they were sacred.</p>
    <p>Not soon after Pala art came to a sudden end after the destruction of monestaries by the invaders of the country in the first half of the thirteenth century. some of the monks and artist fled to Nepal during this time which helped in strenghthning of the existing art traditions there.</p>

    <img src="use6.jpg" alt="Western 2">
  </div>
    <p>The motivating force for the artistic Western India was Jainism that was patronised by the King of Chalukya Dynasty who ruled Gujrat,Malwa and parts of Rajasthan.Example of one of the oldest painting of this school is <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;"> Rishabnath </a> .Twenty four Tirthankars were painted in  these manuscript which are all now available in in the jain <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">bhandaras </a>.The illustrations are very unnique with bold elegant features.One find in this style is the exaggeration of physical traits of a person, for instance, eyes,hips and breasts are enlarged. The figures are drawn flat with simple flat colours.After the palm-leaf use from 1100 to 1400 A.D ,later paper were used for the manuscript. There were two famous and influential manuscript Jain text that were repeated and illustrated .Those scripts are :-(a) The Kalpasutra  (b) The <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Kalakacharya-Katha</a> </p>

    Schools of Central India
    <img src="s23.svg" alt="girl" class="heading-icon">
  </h3>
  <p>The initial phase of miniature/manuscript in central India was marked by the <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Kalpa-Sutra</a>
 illustrations of Mandu (Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh) in as early as the 11th-12th century.</p>
<p>Mandu was the place inluenced by art from every direction just becasue of being in Central India.For example- Jain manuscript of Gujrat,Muslim elements of Jaunpur etc. In 15th century, Mandu was ruled by the Khaliji Dynasty under which the art schools were greatly influenced by persian art style. This could be seen in <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Nimat-Nama </a> . Later during the rule of Sultan Baz Bahadur, there was an inclination for romantic and secular themes. That's when <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Ragmala </a>series, Laur Chanda and etc became subjects. We an easily conclude that the art of central India strated primary with the the influence of Gujrat but further it got developed with wide ranging influence over time.Some of the special features were large protruding eyes, angular faces, men and women of moderate height and usage of plenty of motifs on clothes and large amount of gold color. </p>
<p>The main feature is their frequent continuous narration through their paintings in different compartments.The artists are also excellent in execution of the theme, color scheme and accuracy of even minute details. Some other features of Malwa miniature were the usage of bright colours, blend of folk elements and highly charged faces. Artists took shelter in Mewar,Rajasthan where great miniature art dveloped seperated when muslim rulers took over the central region.The fountain head of Miniature schools in India was made Central School.</p>

  Rajasthan School of Painting
</h2>

  <p><b><u>GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION :-</u></b>Rajasthan is the state surrounded by Pakistan,Punjab,Haryana,Madhya Pradesh,Uttar Pradesh as well as Gujrat. Rajasthan has it's own meaning ,place of Kings (Rajas) or maybe place of Kingdoms (Rajyas) as Rajasthan in early times was famous for many kings and kingdoms.Rajasthani Art was never a new school art ,but it is actually the purified and refined form of the traditional form of Indian art whih was all developed in India, Gujrat as well as Mewar.The artists from central India shifted to Rajasthan enhancing the traditional miniature art too.Rajasthan schhol of art is also called Rajasthani schools or Hindu school of art. The art in Rajasthan was solely based on Hindi literature, Music, Poetry, Rag and Raginis etc.</p>
  <p><b><u>ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF RAJASTHAN ART :-</u></b>Rajasthani art or what we could say Hindu art did not originate as miniature painting initially but it was primarily mural art. The art was developed over the years under the rule of Rajput kings so it is called Rajput Art. Under the rule of Rajputs, the art was influenced mainly from Romance and general folk themes.</p>
  <p>There were two major factors due to which Rajasthani Art flourished. :- firstly,the economin prosperity of commercial community started to encourage literature,music and arts.Secondly,the revival of <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;"> vaishnavism </a> and Bhakti cult against caste sysytem which was against Hinduism.  </p>
  <p>Mewar played an important role in the development of Rajasthani School of Art.Mewar is the mixture of Gujrat and Jain School along with Indian Traditional Art.But Rajasthani art is the pure form of Indian Art.Even today, love scenes of Radha-Krishna are very famous and popular of <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Nathdwara </a>Paintings.</p>
  <p>The sentiments of love and emotions are very beautifully depicted from the pictorial art of Rajasthan. The central theme of most of the Rajasthani paintings is love. Love in all the paintings are used to show the symbol of union.The lovers were mainly presented as Radha and Krishna.The figure of Krishna stands for a divine soul and Radha stands for th human soul.</p>

  Sub-Schools of Rajasthan School
  <img src="s25.svg" alt="Icon" class="sub-icon">
</h3>
  <p><b><u>MEWAR SCHOOL:-</u></b>The Mughal rule affected the whole of Rajasthan but Mewar was not even affected a bit and did not come under the control of mughals till the end. Mewar school did not have any mughal influence so the school fourished as the purest form of Rajasthani School. Later on Jodhpur,Jaipur,Amber,Kota,Bundi,Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan. </p>
   <div class="image-row">
    <img src="use7.jpg" alt="Mewar 1">
    <img src="use8.jpg" alt="Mewar 2">
  </div>
  <p>This school has blend of of western Indian Gujrat-jain manuscript with persian influence which are in Central Indian Style. All the paintings have the artists name and dates proving that the paintings are from sixteenth century,starting from <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;"> Palam Bhagwat</a>(1540-42 - according to the indian historians). In these historical paintings the proportion were not perfect.The use of bold colours and features mark the native style of painting which makes the paintings stand out. Naturalistic drawing was more famous. For example, The Ragamala Series was a continuous series of paintings painted over years under the direct patronage of Rana Pratab followed by many other literary and religious work. These religious works were in most developed stages during the rule of Jagat Singh I . The greatest master of mature Mewar style was Sahibdin (who was the artist of Maru Ragini) whose works are found in abudance. His style brought folk-styled art appreciation.</p>
<br><br><br>
<p><b><u>BUNDI SCHOOL:-</u></b>The Bundi schhol was developed in Kota-Bundi and Jhalawar in the beginning of 17th century while under the Hara Rajput Dynasty.The human figures in the paintings resemble the human figures as in paintings of Mewar schhol but the figures look much more expressive and have a darker color complexion. The nature in background is drawn in realistic style. During further growth in the painting style, the faces became more refined and instead of dark complexion the figures sflesh became pinkish.<a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Brahmasa</a> and <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;">Rasikapriya</a> were also added as themes for the paintings.Mughal influence started showing in the paintings from 18th century. One could guess mughal style from shading,finer lines for the facial expressions and  cleaner lines for perspective. Decanni influece was also noticed in cylinderical forms of women,gardens as well as fountains and architecture.</p>

  </div><br><br><br>
<p><u><b>JODHPUR SCHOOL:-</b></u>Jodhpur also known as Marwar,the largest state of Rajasthan was home to Rathore clans of Rajputs.The Jain style influence was there in initial phase which was followed beacause the patrons were Jain Merchants.Then soon the mughal influence hit as a matronomial alliance with Mughal ruler where royal portraits were more prevalent.Rhythemic lines and jewel like shiny colours showed up in composition between 1760-1780 which marked to the true Jodhpur style painting.The simplicity in these paintings were calming to watch.The female figures were painted as soft, beautiful, simple and with long shiny uplifted eyes.The peak of maturity was reached in the 19th century under the rule of Man Singh who was a great patron and poet himself.Portraits of war heroes called Dugadas Rathore's horse riding portraits were quite famous and popular among the public.

  <br><br><br>

  <p><u><b>BIKANER SCHOOL:-</b></u>The Bikaner schhol was completely under the Mughal influence after its beginning in 17th century maybe because the expelled mughal artist of couts took sheter here or maybe because the rulers took the paintings from mughal atist as a good will gifts. A king named Rai SIngh was very fascinated and influenced by the Mughal Art.Some rulers after tried to encourage indian traditional art but the constant oppression of Mughals did not let art prosper.Libraries were set up and the records of manuscript and paintings were kept.The subjects which were often painted were taken from Hindu Mythology.The paintings from the Bikaner had fine,thin lines and lesser range of colours were used than what are typically used in Mughal Art works. Some of the developed art from Mughal-Bikaner school can be seen in palace walls of Anup Mahal. It was amazing that all the artists were mughals but painted on Hindu themes skillfully.</p>

<p><b><u>KISHANGARH SCHOOL:-</u></b>The estate which was inherited by Kishan Singh, eighth son of Maharaja Uday Singh was named after him, Kishangarh. This small state was surrounded by several other states. Jsipur,Jodhpur and Ajmer saw a sudden a spark of hope when the art of other states were near the end during the rule of Raja Raj Singh and later his son Sawant Singh.</p>
<p>Sawant Singh, the next ruler was a scholar and an expert in art of music, painting and poetry. His pen name was 'Nagri Das' under which he wrote over fifty books. At that time you can see him as one of the most educated ruler. He was a follower of Vallabh sect and a great devotee of Lord Krishna.A girl who was an attendent of his step-mother was the love of his life. The name is not known but was called Bani Thani, which means well dressed or well groomed. She was a dancer,a singer and also had a great knowledge in poetry. Then they were married and together started to live in Vrindaman where this couple got famous for their love stories. Painters often used them as subjects, Bani-Thani as Radha and Sawant-Singh as Lord Krishna (you will get further info in painting of Bani-Thani) </p>

<p>The scenes from court, royal portraits and other royal gatherings were quite famous subjects for painting in Kishangarh school.</p>
<p><b><u>JAIPUR SCHOOL:-</u></b>The peak of Jaipur school was reached in the eighteenth century A.D. This was when the Mughal influence weakened after the rule was ousted. Before this Jaipur School was under the rule of Jai Singh I, the close alliance with Delhi and patronage in art by Akbar remianed deep-rooted. Many of the artists from Jaipur School tried to even caome out of Mughal influence by having painting subjects of Hindu idols,epics and romances of Lord Krishna and Radha but still the effect remained. Jai Singh II was the one who shifted capital from Amber to Jaipur and reorganised painting workshops which were called Surat Khana, where paintings were made and stored.Sahibram was a famous cretive portrait painter and Mohammad Shah was another artist. They were ready to make there own mark in bold composition and also used stylation under Pratab Singh. Pratab Singh had hired around fifty artists in his atelier.</p>

</p>
<p><u>3.Color Schemes:-</u>Color is what brings out the emotions of the painting. Red for anger,passion and fury. Yellow for marvelous and blue for royality. Bright and glowing colors were used for showing harmonious contrast. The pure hues of red, brown, white and other colors were used without mixing any of them.</p>
<p><u>4.Two-Dimensional Paintings:</u> Contours are defined with simple lines and flat pure colours. The background was also painted in flat colours. Perspective details, horizon or skyline are not of much importance to these artists leading to a plane painting or two-dimensional effect.</p>
<p><u>5.Symbolism:</u> Many characters were  used for depiction. Radha and Krishna were depicted symbolically in the human form and God. Radha was symbolised as human figure whereas Krishna was shown as devotional figure. </p>

<p><u>8.Human Figure:</u> During this time period of folk art influence, figures were drawn all identical to each other. They had round faces, pointed noses and elongated eyes like lotus bud. The body was smaller in propotion to that of their face but the proportions were improved over decades. Men have robust body with yellow skin tone and hair reaching till their ears. Female figures were what were frequently painted with bright faces, peach skin tone and long hair reaching further than their waist.</p>
<p><u>9.Depiction of Nature:</u> Different kinds of trees, mountains and water springs were successfully and beautifully depicted in each of the paintings. Birds and animals started to be drawn in paintings with the coming of Mughal influence. The execution wasn't perfect of birds and animals initially but improved later. Nature in the paintings also tells the emotions and mood of the characters in painting. Like,clouds and birds adds to the idead of romance (may it be union or sepreration)</p>
<p><u>10.Depiction of Women:</u> Feminine charm was represented in different modes and moods in brilliant ways. Face and neck were drawn long with high sloping forehead, long pointed noses and well bud-cutted lips. Limbs are shapely with thin fingers. The symbols for comparison are drawn for feminine ideals- bodies are slim, flexible and tall. Eyes are like lotus bud and eyebrows in the shape of bow.</p>
<p>Gracefully, all the female figures resemble each other. Apparently one face was duplicated for all, the difference were the ornaments and clothes in the painting. The women of Kishangarh also had highlight of a lock of hair hanging near the ears adding to the feminine beauty and elegance of the painting.</p>
<p><u>11.Ornaments and Garments:</u> Diamond and pearl studded jewellery were painted on the human figures. The royal human figures were painted with earrings, rings, armlets, bangles, elaborated forehead adornaments and necklaces. Garments of royal figures were very decorative and had a sense of royality.

Males have been shown wearing high turbans and <a href="meaning.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: inherit;"> jhabba </a>, pajama and rajput style patka. Floral prints and strips can be seen as designs of ghaghra in the paintings.</p>
<p><u>12.Landscapes and Seasons:</u> Landscapes were painted differently for each season beautifully. In Bundi school painting, a reddish-orange band of sunset sky are shown with blue. Golden hues were also used for sunset paintings. Perspective was never a main interest but over the time the depth was achieved as the painting styles evolved.</p>
<p><u>13.Night Scenes:</u> Night scenes were painted in an attractive way.The black or smoky grey of the night sky lets the white-yellow coloured moon take the spotlight</p>
