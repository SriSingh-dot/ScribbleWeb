    <h2>History of Miniature Painting</h2>
    <p>Any painting done in small size on any surface, medium or plane is called "Miniature Painting". Earlier in India they were made on palm leaves, a piece of cloth or a piece of leather. After years, it was drawn on handmade paper. Even after being mini in size, the paintings were presented with minute details. These were mainly portraits, an illustration of a story or a painting inspired from daily life of a man. From medieval times Indian Art schools were highly influenced by miniature paintings. We find strong tradition of painting in different schools of painting. Example â€“ The Pala School or Eastern School, the Western Indian School or Jain School of Art.</p>

    <h2>Pala School</h2>
    <p>Ellara and Ajanta were the great centres of Buddhism leaning and art .These schools saw greatest piece of art as murals and frescoes <!--add meaning-->. After this people witnessed a great phase of Buddhism and Buddhism art in India.For real I saw like 100 paintings and sculptures only on Gautam Buddha in the museum. Earlier a large number of manuscript on palm leaves related to Buddhism were written and also illustrated with with buddhist deities .</p>
    <p>The Pala paintings got the name from the Kings Dharam Pal and Dev Pal while their chief artists were Dhiman and his son Vittapal. That reflects and resembles the feelings of classical art of Ajanta. Paintings were of graceful figures and simple composition giving a calming aura. One of the typical Buddhist palm-leaf manuscript which was illustrated in Pala is Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita <!--add meaning-->. It is a manuscript of Mahayana Buddhism and also written in eight thousand lines. The writings were done after leaving some space in the middle for fitting paintings and thereafter the script was sent to painters for illustrations. All the script were binded together with a thread running through two holes made on both side of the folios. But they were damaged over the years as vermillon and sandal paste was smeared on them as they were sacred.</p>
    <p>Not soon after Pala art came to a sudden end after the destruction of monestaries by the invaders of the country in the first half of the thirteenth century. some of the monks and artist fled to Nepal during this time which helped in strenghthning of the existing art traditions there.</p>

    <h2>Western School</h2>
    <p>The motivating force for the artistic Western India was Jainism that was patronised by the King of Chalukya Dynasty who ruled Gujrat,Malwa and parts of Rajasthan.Example of one of the oldest painting of this school is Rishabnath <!--meaning to be added--> .Twenty four Tirthankars were painted in  these manuscript which are all now available in in the jain bhandaras <!--meaning-library-->.The illustrations are very unnique with bold elegant features.One find in this style is the exaggeration of physical traits of a person, for instance, eyes,hips and breasts are enlarged. The figures are drawn flat with simple flat colours.After the palm-leaf use from 1100 to 1400 A.D ,later paper were used for the manuscript. There were two famous and influential manuscript Jain text that were repeated and illustrated .Those scripts are :-(a) The Kalpasutra <!--add meaning The Book of Ritual--> (b) The Kalakacharya-Katha <!--add meaning--> </p>

  <h2>Schools of Central India</h2>
  <p>The initial phase of miniature/manuscript in central India was marked by the Kalpa-Sutra<!--meaning--> illustrations of Mandu (Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh) in as early as the 11th-12th century.</p>
<!--photo-->
<p>Mandu was the place inluenced by art from every direction just becasue of being in Central India.For example- Jain manuscript of Gujrat,Muslim elements of Jaunpur etc. In 15th century, Mandu was ruled by the Khaliji Dynasty under which the art schools were greatly influenced by persian art style. This could be seen in Nimat-Nama <!--meaing--> </p>
