    <h2>History of Miniature Painting</h2>
    <p>Any painting done in small size on any surface, medium or plane is called "Miniature Painting". Earlier in India they were made on palm leaves, a piece of cloth or a piece of leather. After years, it was drawn on handmade paper. Even after being mini in size, the paintings were presented with minute details. These were mainly portraits, an illustration of a story or a painting inspired from daily life of a man. From medieval times Indian Art schools were highly influenced by miniature paintings. We find strong tradition of painting in different schools of painting. Example â€“ The Pala School or Eastern School, the Western Indian School or Jain School of Art.</p>

    <h2>Pala School</h2>
    <p>Ellara and Ajanta were the great centres of Buddhism leaning and art .These schools saw greatest piece of art as murals and frescoes <!--add meaning-->. After this people witnessed a great phase of Buddhism and Buddhism art in India.For real I saw like 100 paintings and sculptures only on Gautam Buddha in the museum. Earlier a large number of manuscript on palm leaves related to Buddhism were written and also illustrated with with buddhist deities .</p>
    <p>The Pala paintings got the name from the Kings Dharam Pal and Dev Pal while their chief artists were Dhiman and his son Vittapal. That reflects and resembles the feelings of classical art of Ajanta. Paintings were of graceful figures and simple composition giving a calming aura. One of the typical Buddhist palm-leaf manuscript which was illustrated in Pala is Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita <!--add meaning-->. It is a manuscript of Mahayana Buddhism and also written in eight thousand lines. The writings were done after leaving some space in the middle for fitting paintings and thereafter the script was sent to painters for illustrations. All the script were binded together with a thread running through two holes made on both side of the folios. But they were damaged over the years as vermillon and sandal paste was smeared on them as they were sacred.</p>
    <p>Not soon after Pala art came to a sudden end after the destruction of monestaries by the invaders of the country in the first half of the thirteenth century. some of the monks and artist fled to Nepal during this time which helped in strenghthning of the existing art traditions there.</p>

    <h2>Western School</h2>
    <p>The motivating force for the artistic Western India was Jainism that was patronised by the King of Chalukya Dynasty who ruled Gujrat,Malwa and parts of Rajasthan.Example of one of the oldest painting of this school is Rishabnath <!--meaning to be added--> .Twenty four Tirthankars were painted in  these manuscript which are all now available in in the jain bhandaras <!--meaning-library-->.The illustrations are very unnique with bold elegant features.One find in this style is the exaggeration of physical traits of a person, for instance, eyes,hips and breasts are enlarged. The figures are drawn flat with simple flat colours.After the palm-leaf use from 1100 to 1400 A.D ,later paper were used for the manuscript. There were two famous and influential manuscript Jain text that were repeated and illustrated .Those scripts are :-(a) The Kalpasutra <!--add meaning The Book of Ritual--> (b) The Kalakacharya-Katha <!--add meaning--> </p>

  <h2>Schools of Central India</h2>
  <p>The initial phase of miniature/manuscript in central India was marked by the Kalpa-Sutra<!--meaning--> illustrations of Mandu (Malwa region of Madhya Pradesh) in as early as the 11th-12th century.</p>
<!--photo-->
<p>Mandu was the place inluenced by art from every direction just becasue of being in Central India.For example- Jain manuscript of Gujrat,Muslim elements of Jaunpur etc. In 15th century, Mandu was ruled by the Khaliji Dynasty under which the art schools were greatly influenced by persian art style. This could be seen in Nimat-Nama <!--meaing--> . Later during the rule of Sultan Baz Bahadur, there was an inclination for romantic and secular themes. That's when Ragmala <!--add meaning-->series, Laur Chanda and etc became subjects. We an easily conclude that the art of central India strated primary with the the influence of Gujrat but further it got developed with wide ranging influence over time.Some of the special features were large protruding eyes, angular faces, men and women of moderate height and usage of plenty of motifs on clothes and large amount of gold color. </p>
<p>The main feature is their frequent continuous narration through their paintings in different compartments.The artists are also excellent in execution of the theme, color scheme and accuracy of even minute details. Some other features of Malwa miniature were the usage of bright colours, blend of folk elements and highly charged faces. Artists took shelter in Mewar,Rajasthan where great miniature art dveloped seperated when muslim rulers took over the central region.The fountain head of Miniature schools in India was made Central School.</p>

  <h2>Rajasthan School Of Painting</h2>
  <p><b><u>GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION :-</u></b>Rajasthan is the state surrounded by Pakistan,Punjab,Haryana,Madhya Pradesh,Uttar Pradesh as well as Gujrat. Rajasthan has it's own meaning ,place of Kings (Rajas) or maybe place of Kingdoms (Rajyas) as Rajasthan in early times was famous for many kings and kingdoms.Rajasthani Art was never a new school art ,but it is actually the purified and refined form of the traditional form of Indian art whih was all developed in India, Gujrat as well as Mewar.The artists from central India shifted to Rajasthan enhancing the traditional miniature art too.Rajasthan schhol of art is also called Rajasthani schools or Hindu school of art. The art in Rajasthan was solely based on Hindi literature, Music, Poetry, Rag and Raginis etc.</p>
  <p><b><u>ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF RAJASTHAN ART :-</u></b>Rajasthani art or what we could say Hindu art did not originate as miniature painting initially but it was primarily mural art. The art was developed over the years under the rule of Rajput kings so it is called Rajput Art. Under the rule of Rajputs, the art was influenced mainly from Romance and general folk themes.</p>
  <p>There were two major factors due to which Rajasthani Art flourished. :- firstly,the economin prosperity of commercial community started to encourage literature,music and arts.Secondly,the revival of vaishnavism <!--add meaning--> and Bhakti cult against caste sysytem which was against Hinduism.  </p>
  <p>Mewar played an important role in the development of Rajasthani School of Art.Mewar is the mixture of Gujrat and Jain School along with Indian Traditional Art.</p>
